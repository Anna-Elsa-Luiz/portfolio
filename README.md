Hello! I'm Anna Elsa Luiz, a passionate data scientist and enthusiastic data explorer. I recently completed a Full-Stack Data Science Masters certification, which equipped me with comprehensive skills in handling end-to-end projects. My academic journey includes a postgraduate degree in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics, and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. 

I thrive on solving complex problems and am particularly keen on learning more about neural networks. My curiosity extends beyond data science; I'm fascinated by human perceptions and am a devoted follower of Bruce Lipton and Joe Dispenza. In my free time, I love diving into new knowledge and exploring the endless possibilities that data and human consciousness offer.
